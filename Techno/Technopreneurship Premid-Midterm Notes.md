**Business Planning and Organizing**

**Types of Organizations**
1.) **Sole Proprietorship**
2.) **Partnership**
3.) **Corporation**

**SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP**
- An individual does business. The owner - personally conducts business. He can do it under his own name or he can do it under a business name
- The essence of a sole proprietorship is that the person is the business. The business is not a separate entity

**Partnership**
- A partnership is both a contract and a business organization
- Two or more individuals contribute money, property, or industry for the purpose of sharing profits among themselves

**Corporation**
- The most common type of business organization
- An artificial being created by operation of law, having the right of succession and the powers, attributes, and properties expressly authorized by law or incident to its existence

**Difference Between Partnership and Corporation**

(as to creation)
**Partnership**: Made by mere consent or agreement of the parties
**Corporation**: Upon approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) evidenced by the issuance of the certificate of incorporation

(as to composition)
**Partnership**: At least two persons
**Corporation**: Not more than 15 incorporators, natural or juridical. May be a One Person Corporation

(as to powers exercised)
**Partnership**: Depends on what the partners agree upon for as long as it is not contrary to laws, morals, good customs, public order or public policy
**Corporation**: Based on what is provided in the Corporation Code and any incidental powers which are expressly granted

(as to the management)
**Partnership**: As a general rule, a partner can bind the partnership
**Corporation**: Only the board of directors acting as a board can bind the corporation individually. A director cannot bind the corporation. They have to act as a board

(as to the liability)
**Partnership**: A partner can be held liable with his personal property
**Corporation**: General rule, all the stockholders will be held liable up to the extent of their contribution. They cannot be liable beyond what they contributed. This is what is known as [Limited Liability]

(as to transfer of interest)
**Partnership**: When a partner transfers his interest, the person to whom his interest is transferred to does not become a partner automatically, he needs the consent of the other partners.
**Corporation**: As a general rule, a stockholder does not need the consent of other stockholders in order to transfer his shares.

(as to successional rights)
**Partnership**: The death of a partner dissolves the partnership
**Corporation**: The death of a stockholder does not dissolve the corporation. Rather, his shares are transmitted to his heirs. This is because a corporation has the right of succession

**Attributes of a Corporation**
**1.) Artificial Being** - It has a separate legal personality created by fiction of law. It is considered a separate juridical entity from its stockholders
**2.) Created by Operation of Law** - In order to create a corporation is mere agreement is not sufficient. It has to have the consent of the state done through the submission of requirements to the SEC. The consent to the state is manifested by the issuance of the certificate of incorporation
**3.) Successional Rights** - Means that if there is a change in the stockholders or board of directors, the corporation continues to exist
**4.) Power and Attributes or Properties Expressly Provided for by Law** - The corporation also has the powers and attributes given by law and incidental to its existence. It means that a corporation can 
	4.1. Sue in its own name
	4.2. Acquire properties
	4.3. Enter into contract

Only the corporation can be held liable even if it was the member of the board who signed the contract in behalf of the corporation

- Also know as equity shares
- Amount of stocks authorized to issue

**Issued** 
- Amount of capital subscribed whether fully paid or not
- Connotes an original subscription contract for the acquisition by a subsriber of unissued shares
- Would therefore preclude the acquisition of shares by reason of subsequent transfer from a stockholder or resale of treasury shares

**Will you be issued a certificate of stock?** 
- No. Just because the stock is subscribed, it doesn't mean that it can have a stock certificate/ It can only be issued if the subsriction is fully paid.
- It can be paid or unpaid, as long as it is covered by a subscription agreement
- If not fully paid, stock subscription

**Subscription** - the transaction when you buy shares from the unissued capital stock of the corporation. It is a primary offering. You buy it directly from the issuing corporation. The document is the subscription agreement.
**Secondary Offering** - if you are buying the shares from another stockholder and not from the corporation, it means that you are already buying issued shares. The document is a deed of assignment

If directly from corporation - Subscription agreement
Not directly - Deed of assignment

**Does it matter if the subscription is paid or unpaid?**

Unissued

**Classes of Shares**
17. Par Value Shares
18. No-Par 
19. Common
20. Preferred
21. Founder's
22. Convertible

**Par VS No-Par**
**Par Value** - amount (price per share) is fixed in the articles of incorporation and in the certificate of stock
**No-Par** - value is not fixed in the articles of incorporation and in the certificate of stock

**Difference**
If the shares have par value, your authorized capital stock would be describe in money terms

**Can a par value share be issued at a price different from its par?**

It depends. It can be issued for higher but it cannot be issued for lower than the par value. If it’s higher that would create your premium or higher paid-in capital. That will not change your authorized capital. Basically, you are just creating a share premium. It would not change your authorized but it will only change your paid-in. But you cannot issue shares lower than the par value because that would turn in into watered stock and that is not allowed under the corporation code.

**Limitation**

A par value share is not as flexible as a no par value share because a no par share can be issued at any price provided that it should not be sold at less than P5 pesos per share.

The nor par value shares affords the corporation flexibility in the issue price of its share in any amount provided that it does not go below P5 per share.

***What does subscription have to do with the payment? So again, what does this mean? What is the difference in terms of payment of par value and no par value shares?***

**Par Value Shares:**

- No specific requirement on the **extent of payment**.

**No Par Value Shares:**

**Common and Preferred**
**Common** - represents the residual right of stockholder over the corporation. Most common type of share. You cannot have a corporation without common shares and you cannot deprive them of voting rights. *The only time common shares are deprived of voting rights is when you have founder's shares*. But founder's shares are only for a limited period. After that common shares will have voting rights again. 

These are shares received by the shareholder pro rata. In the order of the receiving of the dividends, it comes after anything that is remaining after the dividends have been given to the preferred share. Common shares are the ultimate ownership of a corporation. It is the residual Interest after all the creditors have been paid and all the preference have been given.

**Preferred** - are those which will have preference either as to assets of dividends

***If the AOI provides for the common and preferred shares but does not state anything else. What is the assumption?***

For preferred shares it is presumed to be non-cumulative and non-participating.

**Forms of Bid Manipulation**
1. Cover Bidding - when the participants in an auction will agree to basically pad their bid price in order to allow one competitor to win
2. Bid Suppression - they agree that the competitor will not submit their bid again to allow whoever it is that they want to win the bid
3. Bid Rotation - It is similar to cover bidding and bid suppression except that the parties agree that for this bidding, this competitor will win, for the next bidding, another will win, and so on

**Abuse of Dominant Position**
In Abuse of Dominant Position, it is basically a situation wherein a company is a dominant position or has 50% or more of the market share- hence it is dominant.

**Being in a dominant position is not illegal per se, in the same manner that being an insider is not illegal per se.** What is illegal if there is an abuse of the dominant position in such a way that you do predatory pricing, impose barriers to entry, or discriminate in price and you do tying and bundling.

**Merger and Acquisitions which are considered as anti-competitive**

Anti-competitive - any merger or consolidation that restricts or lessen competition
Example: If Globe or Smart will merge, this leaves the public with no choice. That is the essence of anti-competitive mergers or acquisition.
